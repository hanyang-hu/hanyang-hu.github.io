I am a final-year undergraduate student in [Mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) on my summer undergraduate research project and my final year project focused on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes for model-based planning respectively.

I am a participant of the [Special Programme in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/) at NUS and was the aimbot team lead at [NUS Calibur Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscaliburrobotics/posts/?feedView=all) for two years (from 2022 to 2024).

I am looking for internships in robotics (perception and control). Here is my [resume](https://hanyang-hu.github.io/files/hanyang_resume.pdf).
