I am a final-year undergraduate student in [Mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) on my summer undergraduate research project and my final year project focused on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes for model-based reinforcement learning respectively.

I am a participant of the [Special Programme in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/) at NUS and was the aimbot team lead at [NUS Calibur Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscaliburrobotics/posts/?feedView=all) for two years (from 2022 to 2024).

My research interest includes planning and reinforcement learning, with a current focus on enhancing sample efficiency and enabling the online acquisition of new knowledge for uncertainty-aware models (e.g., Gaussian process regression) within limited computation and time budgets. In addition, I am generally interested in exploring methods that could aid data-driven decision-making, such as representation learning and behavioral prediction.

I am looking for research assistantships or internships in relevant fields. Here is my [resume](https://hanyang-hu.github.io/files/hanyang_resume.pdf).
