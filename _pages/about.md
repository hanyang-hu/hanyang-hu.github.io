I am a first-year Masterâ€™s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **UC San Diego**. Currently, I am working on online pose estimation of surgical tools at [ARCLab](https://ucsdarclab.com/). 

For my undergraduate studies, I earned a *B.Sc. in Mathematics (Honours)* from the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, graduating with **Highest Distinction** and receiving the [Ho Family Prize](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/2025/06/30/meet-hu-hanyang/), awarded to *the best overall student in applied mathematics* upon completion of the degree. At NUS, I participated in the [Special Programme in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/) and worked with Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) on projects involving *high-dimensional Bayesian optimization* and *Gaussian processes for model-based planning*. From 2022 to 2024, I was the *software team lead* at [NUS Calibur Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscaliburrobotics/posts/?feedView=all), where I led data collection, algorithm development, and deployment for perception and planning tasks.


I am looking for research internships in robotics (perception and control). Here is my [resume](https://hanyang-hu.github.io/files/hanyang_resume.pdf).
