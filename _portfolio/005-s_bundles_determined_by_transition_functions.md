Inspired by Remark (c) right after Example 2.12 in [Wells] on how to construct a new section by putting together a collection of compatible sections defined on trivializing open sets, I came up with a way to define an \\(\mathcal{S}\\)-bundle isomorphism between \\(E_0\\) and \\(E_1\\) by putting together a collection of compatible \\(\mathcal{S}\\)-bundle isomorphisms between their trivializing open sets.
